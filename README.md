# Small Object Detection - Master's Thesis

## Introduction
Small Object Detection is an emerging field in computer vision, focusing on identifying and classifying objects of relatively small size within images. This is particularly challenging due to limited pixel information and the difficulty in distinguishing these objects from their surroundings. The aim of this thesis is to explore and develop innovative methods for effectively detecting small objects, with potential applications in areas such as surveillance, medical imaging, and autonomous vehicles.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this project include:

1. Investigating current algorithms and techniques in small object detection.
2. Developing a novel approach/model to improve detection accuracy.
3. Evaluating the performance of the proposed solution against existing benchmarks.
