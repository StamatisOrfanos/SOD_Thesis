\chapter{Conclusion}

In this thesis, we introduced the Extended Masked-Attention Mask Transformer, leveraging a novel integration of the 
Enhanced Feature Pyramid Network (EFPN) backbone with the Mask2Former framework to enhance object detection capabilities. 
This architectural evolution aimed at improving efficiency and accuracy, particularly in challenging environments involving small object detection.

Upon evaluating the performance of EMAMT against the traditional Masked-Attention Mask Transformer equipped with a Sliding Window Transformer
backbone, our findings are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item EMAMT demonstrates substantial computational efficiency, reducing model complexity by up to 56\% in terms of the number of trainable parameters compared to MAMT.
    \item In the UAV-SOD dataset, EMAMT not only matched but also slightly exceeded the performance of MAMT, showcasing its suitability for aerial based small object detection tasks.
    \item Conversely, in datasets characterized by diverse object sizes and dense urban environments, such as MS COCO and VisDrone, EMAMT exhibited reductions in mean Average Precision by 6.5\% and 13.7\%, respectively. 
\end{itemize}

For future work, we intend to investigate deeper into EMAMTâ€™s capabilities across a broader spectrum of datasets, aiming to minimize the performance gaps. 
This includes creating a better mechanism to handle the variety of number of object per image, optimizing the interaction between the EFPN backbone and Mask2Former 
found in datasets like VisDrone and MS COCO. Furthermore, we plan to investigate the specific contributions of each of the five feature maps used in the EMAMT architecture. 
By evaluating the impact of each feature map on overall model performance, we aim to identify opportunities to streamline the model further. This could lead to a 
reduction in computational complexity without significant sacrifices in accuracy, especially if some feature maps prove to be less informative than anticipated. 
This analysis will be crucial for optimizing the balance between model depth and performance efficiency.

Additionally, the exploration of further reducing computational demands without compromising the accuracy will be crucial, especially for real-time applications. 
We also plan to extend our testing to include additional object detection frameworks and datasets to verify the generalizability and robustness of EMAMT across 
different scenarios, which will help in further solidifying its efficacy and applicability in practical applications.
