\chapter{Conclusion}

In this thesis, we introduced a novel network-level gradient path design for object detection models, incorporating both ‘top-down’ and ‘bottom-up’ pathways in the network’s ‘neck’. This method is versatile, with applicability to both single-stage and multi-stage models. Upon evaluating the performance of the original models and their modified counterparts using our proposed method, we arrived at the following conclusions: ...
