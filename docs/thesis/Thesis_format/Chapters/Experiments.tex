\section{Datasets}
The datasets that were used for the experiment are the Microsoft Common Object in COntext (MS COCO), Aerial Images Tiny Object Detection (AI-TOD), and VisDrone. The MS COCO and VisDrone datasets were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed architecture by comparing its results with the results of the original models (PANet and TPH-YOLO). The dataset AI-TOD was chosen because it consists of only remote sensing images and the objects in the images only have very few pixels, something that makes it a challenging dataset. ...
