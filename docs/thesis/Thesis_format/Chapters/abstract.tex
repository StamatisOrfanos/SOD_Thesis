\textbf{\Large Abstract} \\
Object detection in remote sensing images has been a challenging problem for the computer vision research community because the objects in such images have 
very few pixels (10-20 pixels). There have been many improvements in the mean Average Precision (mAP) of the models using different techniques, but all these 
improvements come at a cost. The thesis introduces a novel approach that has achieved ...
