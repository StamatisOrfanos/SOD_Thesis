\textbf{\Large Abstract} \\
Object detection in remote sensing images has been a challenging problem for the computer vision research community because the objects in such images have very few
pixels. There have been improvements in the mean Average Precision (mAP) of the models using different architectures. Most of the detection models are becoming more 
complex and bigger, which can cause a problem usually when a detection model is intended for use in a satellite or an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, since their computation 
resources are limited. The thesis introduces a novel approach that has achieved a comparable in computational complexity, to the lightest models in the field.
The model was able to achieve an substantial improvement on the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Small Object Detection (UAV-SOD) and the Visual Drone (visdrone) datasets in 
the order of x\% and y\% accordingly, while maintaining an almost identical performance on the last and most complex dataset the Microsoft Common Object 
in COntext (MS COCO) at z\%.

The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, providing useful intel in multi-task learning and achieving better than most 
computational efficiency with detection performance for the utilized datasets.
