\chapter{Discussion}

The implementation and evaluation of the proposed method on the PANet and TPH-YOLOv5 models produced two different results on the model performances. It was extended that while the implementation of the proposed method on TPH-YOLOv5 significantly reduced the computational cost of the model with little loss in performance or even improvement in performance on a dataset with remote sensing images, the implementation of the method on PANet did not have as much improvement in computational cost and the loss in performance was higher. ...
