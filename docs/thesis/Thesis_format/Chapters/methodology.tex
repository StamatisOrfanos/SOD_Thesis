\section{Architecture}
In this chapter, we demonstrate the overall design that is based on the two-stage model PANet, the framework is illustrated in Figure 18. In our design, we add a Split Stage between the backbone and the “top-down” path of the neck. The purpose of this stage is to split the feature maps of the equivalent levels of the backbone. This is achieved with a 1x1 Convolution layer which reduces the channel dimension of each level to 256-d, which means that we will have 2 × 128-d feature maps for each level. ...
