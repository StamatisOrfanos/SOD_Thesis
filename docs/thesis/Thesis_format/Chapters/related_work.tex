\chapter{Related Work}

This chapter highlights the theories and recent advancements in the fields of remote sensing and computer vision, particularly in small object detection.
By examining previous research that addresses those challenges, this section not only underscores the technological progress achieved but also identifies 
the gaps that the current model aims to bridge. In the field of computer vision, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) \cite{cnn} served as the initial models for 
image analysis, primarily focused on image classification where the entire image is labeled as a single object category. While CNNs had great performance 
in these tasks, their application to object detection in complex images revealed significant limitations.

Object detection models can be broadly categorized by annotation method into anchor-based and anchor-free approaches, and by detection method into dense 
prediction (single-stage) and sparse prediction (multi-stage) techniques. This categorization helps in understanding the diverse strategies employed in 
detecting objects across different scenarios.

This chapter begins with the foundational R-CNN model, which introduced the use of convolutional networks for robust object detection. The following sections 
dive into Fast R-CNN and Faster R-CNN, which iteratively refined the integration of region proposal mechanisms with deep learning, significantly enhancing 
detection efficiency and speed. The exploration continues with Mask R-CNN and Feature Pyramid Networks, which extended capabilities to instance segmentation 
and improved feature representation at multiple scales, respectively.

Single-stage detection models, or dense prediction models, such as YOLO (You Only Look Once) and SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector), streamline the detection 
process by eliminating the need for a separate region proposal step. These models directly predict object classes and bounding box coordinates from full 
images in one evaluation, optimizing for speed and efficiency.

The latter sections of the chapter explore cutting-edge developments like the Vision Transformer and Masked-Attention Mask Transformer, which incorporate 
transformer architectures to push the boundaries of object detection and segmentation.



\section{Multi-stage Object Detection Models}

Multi-stage object detection models involve a more complex process that typically includes distinct phases for generating region proposals and then classifying 
these proposals into specific object categories. These models first isolate potential object locations before applying sophisticated classification and 
bounding box regression techniques. This separation allows for more precise detections and higher overall accuracy, making multi-stage models adept at 
handling complex image scenarios with multiple objects and varying scales. The trade-off, however, is usually slower processing speeds compared to 
single-stage detectors.

\subsection{Region-based Convolution Neural Networks}

The R-CNN family of models represents a fundamental shift in object detection, introducing deep learning to generate high-quality region proposals 
that are then classified by a convolutional neural network. This evolutionary path not only streamlined the detection pipeline but also improved the 
scalability and applicability of these models in real-world scenarios, where speed and accuracy are crucial. The successive refinements from R-CNN 
through Mask R-CNN highlight a trajectory of continuous improvement, with  each iteration bringing more sophisticated integration of features and functionalities.


\subsubsection{Region-based Convolution Neural Networks}

The need for more sophisticated solutions that could accurately identify and locate multiple objects within images led to the development of 
Region-based Convolutional Networks (R-CNNs) \cite{rcnn}. Starting with the base Region-based Convolution Neural Network This approach combines region proposal 
algorithms with the feature extraction capabilities of CNNs. R-CNNs begin by generating potential object-bound regions in an image, a process known 
as region proposal. Each region is then cropped and resized to a fixed size before being fed into a pre-trained convolutional neural network. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{Figures/rcnn.jpeg}
    \caption{Region-based Convolution Neural Network Architecture \cite{rcnn}}
    \label{fig:rcnn}
\end{figure}

As presented in the \ref{fig:rcnn} the R-CNN consists of 3 main modules. The first module generates 2,000 region proposals using the Selective Search 
algorithm. After being resized to a fixed pre-defined size, the second module extracts a feature vector of length 4,096 from each region proposal.
The third module uses a pre-trained SVM algorithm to classify the region proposal to either the background or one of the object classes.


Some the limitations of the R-CNN model are the facts that it is a multi-stage model, where each stage is an independent component, thus, it cannot be 
trained end-to-end. Also the R-CNN depends on the Selective Search algorithm for generating region proposals, which takes a lot of time and cannot be 
customized to the detection problem. Lastly each region proposal is fed independently to the CNN for feature extraction, which makes it impossible to 
run R-CNN in real-time.

\newpage
\subsubsection{Fast Region-based Convolution Neural Networks}

Fast R-CNN \cite{frcnn} improved upon the original R-CNN's efficiency, where instead of cropping and resizing each region separately, the entire image is passed through the 
CNN to extract features. Regions of interest (ROIs) are then selected from the feature map using the proposed bounding boxes from the selective search. 
These ROIs are then pooled into a fixed-size feature map and passed through fully connected layers for classification and bounding box regression 
in the figure \ref{fig:fast-rcnn}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{Figures/fast-r-cnn.png}
    \caption{Fast Region-based Convolution Neural Network Architecture \cite{frcnn}}
    \label{fig:fast-rcnn}
\end{figure}

In this model a proposed a new layer called ROI Pooling that extracts equal-length feature vectors from all proposals in the same image, where 
compared to R-CNN, which has multiple stages, Faster R-CNN builds a network that has only a single stage. 

The RoI pooling layer uses max pooling to convert the features inside any valid region of interest into a small feature map with a fixed spatial 
extent of \(H \times W\) , where $H$ and $W$ are layer hyper-parameters that are independent of any particular RoI. In this paper, an RoI is a rectangular window 
into a convolution feature map. Each RoI is defined by a four-tuple \((r, c, h, w)\) that specifies its top-left corner \((r, c)\) and its height 
and width \((h, w)\). Also one of the great inclusions of this model was the implementation of multi-task loss:

\begin{equation}
    L(p, u, t', v) = L_{cls}(p, u) + \lambda [u \geq 1] L_{loc}(t', v)z   \tag{1}
\end{equation}

,where the classification loss \(L_{cls}(p, u)\) is defined as the negative log likelihood of the true class \(u\), expressed as:
\begin{equation}
    L_{cls}(p, u) = -\log p_u \tag{2}
\end{equation}

The localization loss \(L_{loc}\) is defined over the predicted bounding box parameters \(t' = (t'_x, t'_y, t'_w, t'_h)\) and the ground truth bounding 
box parameters \(v = (v_x, v_y, v_w, v_h)\) for class \(u\). The Iverson bracket \([u \geq 1]\) is used as an indicator function that evaluates to 1 
when \(u\) is 1 or more, and 0 otherwise. This function helps in applying the localization loss only when there is a foreground class detected, 
effectively ignoring the background.

The overall loss \(L(p, u, t', v)\) is then a combination of classification and localization losses, modulated by a parameter \(\lambda\), representing the trade-off between these two tasks:
\begin{equation}
    L(p, u, t', v) = L_{cls}(p, u) + \lambda [u \geq 1] L_{loc}(t', v)   \tag{3}
\end{equation}

\newpage
\subsubsection{Faster Region-based Convolution Neural Networks}

While Fast R-CNN improved upon its predecessors in terms of both speed and accuracy, the Faster R-CNN  architecture \cite{frrcnn} emerged as an even more refined version. 
Fast R-CNN effectively addressed the inefficiencies of previous models by integrating a region of interest (RoI) pooling layer to connect convolutional 
feature extraction and region proposal tasks. However, it still relied on external region proposal algorithms, which remained a bottleneck in terms of 
computational efficiency and speed. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{Figures/faster-rcnn.jpeg}
    \caption{Faster Region-based Convolution Neural Network Architecture \cite{frrcnn}}
    \label{fig:faster-rcnn}
\end{figure}

Faster R-CNN resolved this by introducing a novel component, the Region Proposal Network (RPN). A Region Proposal Network takes an image
(of any size) as input and outputs a set of rectangular object proposals, each with an objectness score. This process is modeled with a fully 
convolutional network, because the ultimate goal is to share its computation with a Fast R-CNN object detection network, as it is assumed that 
both nets share a common set of convolutional layers, as seen in the Figure \ref{fig:faster-rcnn}.


To generate region proposals, a small network slides over the convolutional feature map output by the last shared convolutional layer. This small
network takes as input an $n \times n$ spatial window of the input convolutional feature map. Each sliding window is mapped to a lower-dimensional feature.
This feature is fed into two sibling fully-connected layersâ€”a box-regression layer (reg layer) and a box-classification layer (cls layer). This mini-network 
is illustrated at a single position in the Figure \ref{fig:anchors}. Also since the mini-network operates in a sliding-window fashion, the 
fully-connected layers are shared across all spatial locations. 

This architecture is naturally implemented with an nÃ—n convolutional layer followed by two sibling $1 \times 1$ convolutional layers. 

\newpage
At each sliding-window location, there is simultaneously a prediction of multiple region proposals, where the number of maximum possible proposals for each location is
denoted as k. The k proposals are parameterized relative to k reference boxes, which are called  anchors. An anchor is centered at the sliding window
in question, and is associated with a scale and aspect ratio as seen again in Figure \ref{fig:anchors}. By default 3 scales and 3 aspect ratios are used, 
yielding k = 9 anchors at each sliding position. For a convolutional feature map of a size $W \times H$, there are $W \times H \times k$ anchors in total.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.1]{Figures/anchors.jpeg}
    \caption{Region Proposal Network \cite{frrcnn}}
    \label{fig:anchors}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Masked Region-based Convolution Neural Networks}

Mask R-CNN \cite{mrcnn} builds on the ideas and successes of the Faster R-CNN model, which predicts both a class label and a bounding-box offset for each candidate object. 
To these, Mask R-CNN adds a third branch specifically designed to output the object mask, providing a straightforward and logical extension to the 
existing framework. This addition allows Mask R-CNN to capture the precise spatial layout of objects, a task that necessitates extracting significantly 
finer detail than what is required for classifying objects or predicting bounding boxes alone.

Mask R-CNN adopts the same two-stage procedure as Faster R-CNN, with an identical first stage the RPN. In the second stage, in parallel to predicting 
the class and box offset, Mask R-CNN also outputs a binary mask for each RoI. This is in contrast to most recent systems, where classification 
depends on mask predictions. This approach follows the spirit of Fast R-CNN that applies bounding-box classification and regression in parallel.


\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Figures/mask-r-cnn.png}
    \caption{Mask Region Convolution Neural Network Architecture \cite{mrcnn}}
    \label{fig:mask-r-cnn}
\end{figure}

\newpage
A mask encodes an input objectâ€™s spatial layout. Thus, unlike class labels or box offsets that are inevitably collapsed into short output vectors by
fully-connected layers, extracting the spatial structure of masks can be addressed naturally by the pixel-to-pixel correspondence provided by convolutions.
Specifically, an $m \times m$ mask is predicted from each RoI using an FCN. This allows each layer in the mask branch to maintain the explicit $m \times m$ object 
spatial layout without collapsing it into a vector representation that lacks spatial dimensions. Unlike previous methods that resort to fully-connected layers 
for mask prediction, this fully convolutional representation requires fewer parameters, and is more accurate as demonstrated by experiments.

This pixel-to-pixel behavior requires our RoI features, which themselves are small feature maps, to be well aligned to faithfully preserve the explicit 
per-pixel spatial correspondence. This motivated us to develop the following RoIAlign layer that plays a key role in mask prediction.

RoIPool is a standard operation for extracting a small feature map like \(7 \times 7\) from each RoI. RoIPool first quantizes a floating-number RoI to the 
discrete granularity of the feature map, this quantized RoI is then subdivided into spatial bins  which are themselves quantized, and finally feature 
values covered by each bin are aggregated usually by max pooling. 

Quantization, such as that performed on a continuous coordinate $x$ by calculating \(\frac{x}{16}\), where 16 represents the feature map stride accompanied
by the rounding. Similarly, this quantization process occurs when coordinates are divided into discrete bins, for example, into a $7x7$ grid. However, these 
quantization steps can lead to slight misalignments between the Region of Interest (RoI) and the features extracted from it, potentially affecting the accuracy 
of the model.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.30]{Figures/mask-r-cnn-roi-align.png}
    \caption{Mask Region Of  \cite{mrcnn}}
    \label{fig:roi-align}
\end{figure}

While this may not impact classification, which is robust to small translations, it has a large negative effect on predicting pixel-accurate masks.
To address this, a RoIAlign layer is proposed that removes the harsh quantization of RoIPool, properly aligning the extracted features with the input. 
A bilinear interpolation is used to compute the exact values of the input features at four regularly sampled locations in each RoI bin, and aggregate 
the result.

Furthermore once again this model utilizes a multi-task loss in order to take into consideration all the outputs of the model.
\begin{equation}
    L = L_{cls} + L_{box} + L_{mask} \tag{4}
\end{equation}
 
The mask branch has a $K \times m^2$-dimensional output for each RoI, which encodes K binary masks of resolution m Ã— m, one for each of the K classes.
To this a per-pixel sigmoid is applied, and define Lmask as the average binary cross-entropy loss. For an RoI associated with ground-truth class k, 
$L_{mask}$ is only defined on the k-th mask. This definition of $L_{mask}$ allows the network to generate masks for every class without competition 
among classes, since on the dedicated classification branch to predict the class label used to select the output mask. This decouples mask and 
class prediction. This is different from common practice when applying FCNs to semantic segmentation, which typically uses a per-pixel softmax and a 
multinomial cross-entropy loss. In that case, masks across classes compete; in our case, with a per-pixel sigmoid and a binary
loss, they do not.


\subsection{Feature Pyramid Networks}

The concept of Feature Pyramid Networks (FPNs) was a significant advancement in object detection and segmentation, by leveraging the inherent multi-scale, 
pyramidal hierarchy of deep convolutional networks. The first subsection details the basic Feature Pyramid Network, an architecture that efficiently creates 
a pyramid of features at multiple levels, enabling the detection of objects at various scales with improved accuracy. This structure uses a top-down approach 
with lateral connections to combine low-resolution, semantically strong features with high-resolution, semantically weaker features, enhancing the networkâ€™s 
ability to detect objects across different scales. The subsequent subsection explores the Extended Feature Pyramid Network, which builds upon the original FPN 
by introducing enhancements that further refine feature integration and improve detection performance, particularly in challenging scenarios with complex object 
orientations and scales.


\subsubsection{Feature Pyramid Network}

With Feature Pyramid Networks \cite{fpn} the objective is to harness the pyramidal feature hierarchy of a Convolutional Networks, which inherently contains semantic 
information from low to high levels, to construct a feature pyramid that maintains high-level semantics throughout. The method processes a single-scale 
image of arbitrary size and produces proportionally sized feature maps at multiple levels, utilizing a fully convolutional approach. This procedure is 
compatible with various backbone convolutional architectures, and this paper demonstrates results using ResNets. The construction of the pyramid incorporates 
a bottom-up pathway, a top-down pathway, and lateral connections, which are detailed below and seen in the Figure \ref{fig:fpn}.

The bottom-up pathway is the feed forward computation of the ConvNet backbone, which computes a feature hierarchy consisting of feature maps at several scales 
with a scaling step of 2. There are often many layers producing output maps of the same size and these layers are in the same network stage. For the 
feature pyramid, one pyramid level for each stage is defined. The output of the last layer of each stage is chosen as the reference set of feature maps, 
which will be enriched to create the pyramid. This choice is logical because the deepest layer of each stage is expected to have the strongest features.

Specifically, for ResNets, the feature activations output by the last residual block of each stage are utilized. These outputs are denoted as ${C2, C3, C4, C5}$ 
corresponding to the outputs of conv2, conv3, conv4, and conv5, respectively. It is important to note that these have strides of ${4, 8, 16, 32}$ pixels with 
respect to the input image. The conv1 output is not included in the pyramid due to its large memory footprint.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Figures/fpn-base.png}
    \caption{Feature Pyramid Network \cite{fpn}}
    \label{fig:fpn}
\end{figure}

The top-down pathway hallucinates higher resolution features by up-sampling spatially coarser, but semantically stronger, feature maps from higher pyramid levels. 
These features are then enhanced with features from the bottom-up pathway via lateral connections. Each lateral connection merges feature maps of the same 
spatial size from the bottom-up pathway and the top-down pathway. The bottom-up feature map is of lower-level semantics, but its activations are more accurately 
localized as it was sub-sampled fewer times. With a coarser-resolution feature map, the spatial resolution is up-sampled by a factor of 2. The up-sampled map is 
then merged with the corresponding bottom-up map (which undergoes a 1Ã—1 convolutional layer to reduce channel dimensions) by element-wise addition 
as seen in the figure \ref{fig:fpn-top}. This process is iterated until the finest resolution map is generated. To start the iteration, simply attach a 
1Ã—1 convolutional layer on $C5$ to  produce the coarsest resolution map. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Figures/fpn-top-down.jpg}
    \caption{Feature Pyramid Network Top-Down path \cite{fpn}}
    \label{fig:fpn-top}
\end{figure}


Finally a 3Ã—3 convolution is added on each merged map to generate the final feature map, which is to reduce the aliasing effect of up-sampling. 
This final set of feature maps is called ${P2, P3, P4, P5}$, corresponding to ${C2, C3, C4, C5}$ that are respectively of the same spatial sizes.
Since all levels of the pyramid use shared classifiers/regressors as in a traditional featurized image pyramid, a fixed feature dimension 
or numbers of channels is set, with the value being denoted as $d$ in all the feature maps. With $d = 256$ in this paper and thus all extra convolutional 
layers have 256-channel outputs. Simplicity is central to this design and it has been proven that this model is robust to many design choices.
Experiments with more sophisticated blocks have been made and observed marginally better results.

\subsubsection{Extended Feature Pyramid Network}  \label{efpn-section}

The implementation of the Extended Feature Pyramid follows closely an FPN-like framework embedded with a feature Super Resolution (SR) \cite{sr} module. 
This pipeline directly generates high resolution features from low-resolution images to support small object detection, while stays in low computational 
cost. The top four pyramid layers are constructed by top-down pathways for medium and large object detection. 

The bottom extension of the EFPN  contains the very important Feature Texture Transfer (FTT) module, the top-down pathway and the purple pyramid layer in 
\ref{fig:efpn}, that aims to capture regional details for small objects. More specifically, in the extension, the third and fourth pyramid layers of EFPN which 
are denoted by green and yellow layers respectively in \ref{fig:efpn}, are mixed up in the feature super resolution module, the FTT with the aim of producing the 
intermediate feature $P'_{3}$ with selected regional information, which is denoted by a blue diamond in Figure \ref{fig:efpn}. Finally the top-down pathway merges 
$P'_{3}$ with a tailor-made high-resolution CNN feature map $C'2$, producing the final extended pyramid layer $P'2$.


\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.15]{Figures/efpn.jpg}
    \caption{Extended Feature Pyramid Network \cite{efpn}}
    \label{fig:efpn}
\end{figure}

The current Feature Texture Transfer (FTT) output as seen in the figure  synthesizes strong semantics in upper low-resolution features and critical local details in lower high-resolution 
reference features, but discards disturbing noises in reference. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:ftt}, the main input of FTT module is the feature map P3
from the 3rd layer of EFPN, and the reference is the feature map P2 from the 4th layer of EFPN. 

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.18]{Figures/fft.png}
    \caption{Feature Texture Transfer \cite{efpn}}
    \label{fig:ftt}
\end{figure}

\newpage
The output $P'_3$ can be defined as:

\begin{equation}
    P'_3 = E_t(P_2 \Vert E_c(P_3)_{\uparrow 2}) + E_c(P_3)_{\uparrow 2} \tag{5}
\end{equation}


,where where $E_t()$ denotes texture extractor component, $E_c()$ denotes content extractor component, $\uparrow 2\times$ here denotes double up-scaling by 
sub-pixel convolution and k denotes feature concatenation. The content extractor and texture extractor are both composed of residual blocks. In the main stream, 
a sub-pixel convolution is applied to upscale spatial resolution of the content features from the main input $P3$ considering its efficiency.
Sub-pixel convolution augments pixels on the dimensions of width and height via diverting pixels on the dimension of channel.

\newpage
\subsection{Vision Transformers}

The Vision Transformer (ViT) \cite{visiontr} introduces a paradigm shift in object detection by applying the attention mechanism, a core component of its architecture, 
originally designed for natural language processing tasks. Unlike traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that process image data through local receptive 
fields, ViT utilizes a self-attention mechanism that allows the model to weigh and prioritize different parts of the image based on their relevance to the task. 
This mechanism treats images as sequences of patches and computes attention scores that indicate how much focus should be placed on each patch relative to others, 
enabling the model to capture complex inter-patch relationships and contextual nuances.

This characteristic of Vision Transformers to leverage attention-driven, global feature representations marks a significant advancement in object detection, promising 
more precise and robust models capable of handling the diverse challenges present in real world image data. In a transformer model for NLP, the encoder processes 
the input text by mapping it into a high-dimensional space to capture contextual relationships, while the decoder generates the output text sequentially, using the 
encoder's context-rich representations along with its own input to predict the next word or sequence, thereby facilitating tasks like translation, summarization, 
and text generation. The architecture of a transformer model can be seen in the figure \ref{fig:tr-base}, where the left part is the transformer encoder and the 
right part is the decoder.


\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.15]{Figures/transformer_basis.jpg}
    \caption{NLP Transformer Architecture \cite{visiontr}}
    \label{fig:tr-base}
\end{figure}

In object detection, this capability allows ViT to effectively identify and focus on areas of an image that are more informative for recognizing and localizing objects. 
For example, in scenes where objects are small or occluded, the attention mechanism can highlight subtle features that distinguish these objects from their surroundings, 
which might be overlooked by the fixed kernels of CNNs. 

\newpage
Furthermore, ViT can be integrated into both one-stage and two-stage detection frameworks. In one-stage detectors, ViT can directly predict bounding boxes and class 
labels by processing the global context provided by the attention mechanism, enhancing detection accuracy without the need for separate region proposal stages. 
Moreover, in two-stage frameworks like Faster R-CNN, ViT can serve as a backbone where the transformer encodes global contextual information, which is then used to 
guide the region proposal network and the subsequent bounding box refinement and classification stages. This use of global context is particularly beneficial for 
handling complex detection scenarios, such as crowded scenes where objects intermingle or overlap extensively.

On the other hand, the ViT encoder processes the input image, which is divided into patches and linearly embedded. The encoder's self-attention mechanism 
allows the model to consider each patch in the context of others, capturing the global context of the image. This is crucial for tasks like image 
classification or object detection, where understanding the entire image context is important. The encoder is responsible for understanding the content and 
context of the image, learning to identify features and patterns relevant to the task at hand. Furthermore ViTs typically do not use a decoder because their 
primary tasks do not involve generating sequential data as is the case in machine translation or text generation in NLP. Instead, the output of the ViT 
encoder is directly connected to task-specific heads like linear layers for classification or additional layers for object detection that interpret the 
encoder's representations to make predictions.


\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{Figures/vision-transformer.jpg}
    \caption{Vision Transformer Architecture \cite{visiontr}}
    \label{fig:tr-vit}
\end{figure}

In the pre-transformer encoder stage of processing an image, the initial input, typically of size \(H \times W \times D\) (height, width, depth), 
is segmented into \(N\) non-overlapping patches. Each patch has dimensions \(P \times P \times D\) and is extracted in a grid-like pattern across 
the image. These patches are then flattened and undergo a linear projection to transform them into a higher-dimensional space, with each patch represented 
as a one-dimensional array. To ensure that spatial information is not lost during this transformation, positional encodings of the same dimension, 
\(D'\), are added to these patch embeddings. This results in each patch embedding maintaining a sequence of vectors, each with dimension \(D'\). 
The linear projection itself is facilitated by a learnable matrix that the flattened patches are multiplied with, culminating in an array of size 
\(N \times D'\), where each row represents the embedded representation of a patch. This structured approach allows the model to retain a detailed 
understanding of the original imageâ€™s spatial layout as it processes through the transformer encoder.


The transformer encoder in image processing is composed of several transformer blocks arranged in sequence, each designed to refine the representation of image 
patches through a series of specialized sub-components. Each block starts with Layer Normalization, which is applied before self-attention and MLP operations 
to stabilize the training process and facilitate model convergence. Unlike batch normalization, layer normalization is preferred in transformers as they handle 
sequential data, ensuring that the size of the data remains at \(N \times D'\).

Following normalization, the Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHA) mechanism is used, accepting queries, keys, and values as inputs. This allows 
the model to simultaneously focus on different parts of the image, enhancing the contextual understanding of the image by computing attention scores and 
updating embeddings without altering the initial data size of \(N \times D'\).

Residual Connections are employed after MHA and MLP within each transformer block, where the input to the block is added back to its output. 
This practice helps preserve information across the layers, combating the vanishing gradient problem and facilitating deeper model architectures by 
improving gradient flow.

Additionally, each block contains an MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) segment, which includes fully connected layers featuring a GELU activation function 
and often incorporates dropout to prevent overfitting. This component further processes the output of the self-attention mechanism before it passes 
through another round of residual connections.The cumulative effect of these operations in each transformer block is to continuously refine the embeddings, 
with the input and output of each block being arrays of size \(N \times D'\), effectively updating the representation at each step of the sequence.


In the post-transformer encoder phase of image processing, several critical modules refine the processed features for specific tasks such as object detection 
and classification. The MLP Head is employed immediately after the transformer encoder to project the encoded features into a lower-dimensional space that 
is more suitable for object detection tasks. The dimensionality of the MLP head's output varies depending on its architecture and the specifics of the object 
detection task being performed, adapting the complex, high-dimensional data into a form that can be effectively used for the subsequent steps.

\newpage
\subsubsection{Masked-Attention Mask Transformer} \label{mamt}

Mask classification architectures group pixels into N segments by predicting N binary masks, along with N corresponding category labels. 
Mask classification is general enough to address any segmentation or object detection task by assigning different semantics.
However, the  challenge is to find good representations for each segment. Inspired by DETR \cite{e2evisiontr}, each segment in an image can be represented as a 
C-dimensional feature vector know as object query and can be processed by a Transformer decoder, trained with a set prediction objective. A simple meta 
architecture would consist of three components. 

A backbone that extracts low resolution features from an image. A pixel decoder that gradually up-samples low-resolution features from the output of the 
backbone to generate high-resolution per-pixel embeddings. And finally a Transformer decoder that operates on image features to process object queries. 
The final binary mask predictions are decoded from per-pixel embeddings with object queries. One successful instantiation of such a meta architecture is 
MaskFormer\cite{mamt}.


Mask2Former adopts this kind meta architecture, with the proposed Transformer decoder in the Figure \ref{fig:mamt} replacing the standard one. The key 
components of the Transformer decoder include a masked attention operator, which extracts localized features by constraining cross attention to within the 
foreground region of the predicted mask for each query, instead of attending to the full feature map. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{Figures/MaskAttentionMaskTransformer.jpg}
    \caption{Masked-Attention Mask Transformer \cite{mamt2}}
    \label{fig:mamt}
\end{figure}


To handle small objects, an efficient multi-scale strategy is proposed to utilize high-resolution features. It feeds successive feature maps from the 
pixel decoderâ€™s feature pyramid into successive Transformer  decoder layers in a round robin fashion. 
Context features have been shown to be important for image segmentation. However, recent studies \cite{instasqueries, FaPN, segmenter} suggest that the slow convergence of 
Transformer-based models is due to global context in the cross-attention layer, as it takes many training epochs for cross-attention to learn to attend to 
localized object regions. 

\newpage
There is the hypothesize that local features are enough to update query features and context information can be gathered through self-attention. 
For this a masked attention was proposed, a variant of cross attention that only attends within the foreground region of the predicted mask for each query. 
Standard cross-attention computes:

\begin{equation}
    X_l = \text{softmax}(Q_l K_l^T) V_l + X_{l-1} \tag{6}
\end{equation}

Here, $l$ is the layer index, $X_l \epsilon R^{N \times C}$ refers to N C-dimensional query features at the $l$th layer and 
$Q_l = f_Q(X_l-1) \epsilon R^{N \times C} $. Here $X_0$ denotes input query features to the Transformer decoder. $K_l, V_l \epsilon R^{H_l W_l \times C}$ are the 
image features under transformation $f_K()$ and $f_{V}()$ respectively, and $H_l$ and $W_l$ are the spatial resolution of image features, $f_Q$, $f_K$ and $f_V$ are 
linear transformations


Our masked attention modulates the attention matrix via:

\begin{equation}
    X_l = \text{softmax}(\mathcal{M}_{l-1} + Q_l K_l^T) V_l + X_{l-1} \tag{7}
\end{equation}


Moreover, the attention mask $M_{l-1}$ at feature location (x, y) is:

\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{M}_{l-1}(x, y) = 
    \begin{cases} 
    0 & \text{if } \mathcal{M}_{l-1}(x, y) = 1 \\
    -\infty & \text{otherwise} 
    \end{cases}  \tag{8}
\end{equation}
    

Here, $M_{l-1} \epsilon \{0, 1\}^{N \times H_l W_l}$  is the binarized output, thresholded at 0.5 of the resized mask prediction of the previous $(l - 1)$-th 
Transformer decoder layer. It is resized to the same resolution of $K_l$. $M_0$ is the binary mask prediction obtained from $X_0$, before feeding query features
into the Transformer decoder.

High-resolution features improve model performance, especially for small objects \cite{e2evisiontr}, however, this is computationally demanding. 
Thus the solution being an efficient multi-scale strategy to introduce high-resolution features while controlling the increase in computation. 
Instead of always using the high-resolution feature map, a feature pyramid which consists of both low- and high-resolution features is utilized and 
feed one resolution of the  multi-scale feature to one Transformer decoder layer at a time. Specifically, the feature pyramid produced by the 
pixel decoder with resolution $1/32, 1/16$ and $1/8$ of the original image. For each resolution, both a sinusoidal positional embedding 
$e_{pos} \epsilon R^{HlWlÃ—C}$ and a learnable scale-level embedding $e_{lvl} \epsilon R^{1 \times C}$ is added. 

We use those, from lowest-resolution to highest-resolution for the corresponding Transformer decoder layer as shown in Figure \ref{fig:mamt}. This is 
repeated for a 3-layer Transformer decoder L times. In this case the final Transformer decoder hence has 3L layers. 

More specifically, the first three layers receive a feature map of resolution $H1 = H/32, H2 = H/16, H3 = H/8, W1 = W/32, W2 = W/16, W3 = W/8$, 
where $H$ and $W$ are the original image resolution. This pattern is repeated in a round robin fashion for all following layers.

\section{Single-stage Object Detection Models}

Single-stage object detection models represent a streamlined approach to identifying and localizing objects within an image. Unlike multi-stage models, 
single-stage models, such as YOLO (You Only Look Once) and SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector), operate in a direct manner by predicting object classes and 
bounding box coordinates in a single forward pass through the network. This methodology not only simplifies the detection pipeline but also enhances the 
speed of detection, making single-stage models particularly well-suited for real-time applications. However, this increase in speed can sometimes come at 
the cost of lower accuracy, especially in detecting small or overlapping objects.

\subsection{You Only Look Once}

YOLO (You Only Look Once) \cite{yolo} represents a shift in object detection techniques through its simple and highly efficient approach. Unlike traditional 
object detection methods that involve a multi-step process, YOLO employs a single convolutional network that simultaneously predicts multiple bounding boxes 
and class probabilities for those boxes. This process is followed by a non-maximum suppression step to finalize the detections. The architecture is based on a 
standard high-quality image classification network truncated before any classification layers, known as the base network, which is then augmented with additional 
layers to detect objects at multiple scales.

One of the primary benefits of YOLO is its speed, achieving real-time processing rates of up to 45 frames per second on a Titan X GPU, and a fast 
version that exceeds 150 fps. This capability allows YOLO to handle streaming video in real-time with close to no latency, significantly outperforming other 
real-time systems in mean average precision. Moreover, YOLO reasons globally about the image during both training and testing phases, which helps it encode 
contextual information about object classes and their appearances. This global perspective reduces background errors significantly compared to methods like 
Fast R-CNN, which often misclassify background patches as objects.

In addition, YOLO learns generalizable representations of objects, demonstrated by its superior performance when trained on natural images and tested on 
artwork, outperforming other top detection methods. However, while YOLO excels in identification speed and generalizability, it sometimes struggles with 
precisely localizing objects, particularly small ones. 


\newpage
The network divides the input image into an \(S \times S\) grid, with each grid cell responsible for 
detecting objects whose centers fall within the cell. Each cell predicts multiple bounding boxes and confidence scores, which reflect the presence and 
accuracy of object detection. These predictions are based on the intersection over union (IOU) metric between the predicted boxes and ground truth.

    \includegraphics[scale=0.55]{Figures/yolo.jpg}
    \caption{YOLO Architecture \cite{yolo}}
    \label{fig:yolo}
\end{figure}


The convolutional neural network of YOLO, inspired by the GoogLeNet model for image classification, comprises 24 convolutional layers followed by 2 fully 
connected layers. This structure utilizes \(1 \times 1\) reduction layers followed by \(3 \times 3\) convolutional layers to efficiently predict bounding 
boxes and class probabilities. Despite its strengths, YOLO imposes certain spatial constraints on bounding box predictions due to each grid cell predicting 
only two boxes and one class, which can limit its effectiveness in scenarios with small or clustered objects. Additionally, YOLO's simpler architecture 
struggles with unusual object aspect ratios and configurations and is less forgiving of localization errors in smaller bounding boxes due to its coarse 
feature predictions and the uniform treatment of errors across all box sizes in its loss function.

In conclusion, YOLOâ€™s innovative approach integrates the components of object detection into a single neural network, leveraging features from the entire 
image to make global predictions about all objects present. This end-to-end training capability and real-time processing speed maintain high average 
precision, making YOLO a groundbreaking model in the field of object detection, despite some challenges with small and closely spaced objects.

\subsection{Single Shot MultiBox Detector}

The Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) \cite{ssd} employs a streamlined architecture that integrates detection and classification into a single pass through a 
feed-forward convolutional network, thereby enhancing speed without compromising accuracy. This model produces a fixed collection of bounding boxes and 
class scores for each object instance identified, followed by a non-maximum suppression step to finalize the detections. The foundation of SSD is a 
base network derived from standard high-quality image classification architectures, which is truncated before any classification layers. 

To adapt this base network for object detection, SSD incorporates multiple convolutional feature layers at the end of the network. These additional layers 
decrease progressively in size, allowing for the detection of objects at various scalesâ€”a notable improvement over models like Overfeat and YOLO, which 
are limited to single scale feature maps. Each feature layer in SSD employs a unique set of convolutional filters to predict detection outcomes at that scale, 
thus enhancing the model's responsiveness to objects of varying dimensions as seen in the Figure \ref{fig:ssmd}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.55]{Figures/ssmbd.jpg}
    \caption{Single Shot MultiBox Detector Architecture \cite{ssd}}
    \label{fig:ssmd}
\end{figure}

SSD further refines its detection capabilities through the use of convolutional predictors at each feature layer. These predictors apply a 3Ã—3Ã—p 
convolutional kernel to each feature map location, generating scores for category presence or box shape offsets relative to predefined default boxes. 
These default boxes, similar to the anchor boxes used in Faster R-CNN but applied across multiple resolutions, are associated with each feature map cell. 
For each default box, the model computes class scores and spatial offsets, improving detection precision. This mechanism results in an extensive set of outputs 
for each feature map cell, ensuring robust detection across a diverse array of object types and sizes.
