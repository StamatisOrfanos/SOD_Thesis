# To build the architecture with the specified details, we'll need to connect the Backbone, Pixel Decoder,
# and Transformer Encoders. Each Transformer Encoder will be responsible for a different resolution of feature maps.
# The mask will be assumed to be a trainable parameter within the Transformer Encoder.
# To connect the Backbone, Pixel Decoder, and Transformer Encoder into a single model architecture, you can define a new 
# class that integrates all these components. This class will take an image as input and generate feature maps at different
#  scales, and then apply a Transformer Encoder to each feature map.
